CHANGES in v.0.2.0

  * Added function plotAreaInROPE.

  * In BESTpower, call to x11() (which is platform specific) changed to dev.new();
  in Rstudio, the plot is shown on active device.

  * BESTmcmc and BESTpower gain 'rnd.seed' arguments for reproducible output;
	testthat test files for BESTmcmc and BESTpower added.
	
  * makeData gains a showPlot argument.

  * Fixed bug in plot.BEST: the ... argument was not being passed to plotPost.
	
  * BESTmcmc has 'verbose' argument; setting verbose = FALSE (or 0) suppresses
	output to the Console (wish of Ben Marwick).

  * BESTpower also has 'verbose' argument; here verbose = 0 (or FALSE) 
	suppresses all output, verbose = 1 (or TRUE) provides just a progress bar;
	verbose = 2 (the default) displays full details.
