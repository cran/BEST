CHANGES in v.0.5.0 (2017-05-28)

  * 'BESTmcmc' uses 'rjags' directly, instead of 'jagsUI' wrappers. This resolves 'set.seed' issues, but values returned will not be the same as with previous versions.

  * Function 'hdi' removed; imports HDInterval::hdi instead.

CHANGES in v.0.4.0 (2015-12-28)

  * BESTmcmc now allows normality parameter, nu < 1 (See John Kruschke's blog post 2 Dec 2015).

  * Vignette updated to use new prior specification.

CHANGES in v.0.3.0 (2015-06-29)

  * BESTmcmc 'showPriors' argument changed to 'doPriorsOnly'.

  * Function postPriorOverlap added.

CHANGES in v.0.2.6 (2015-05-09)

  * BESTmcmc gains a 'showPriors' argument.

  * Removed constraints on small samples in BESTmcmc (n=1 is ok if priors are specified).

  * makeData throws an error if the number of outliers is 1.

CHANGES in v.0.2.5 (2015-05-07)

  * Run chains in parallel using jagsUI (>= 1.3.6) instead of rjags.

CHANGES in v.0.2.4 (2015-05-03)

  * Function BESTmcmc now allows user to specify priors.

CHANGES in v.0.2.3 (2014-11-17)

  * Added sanity checks to BESTmcmc.

CHANGES in v.0.2.2 (2014-06-06)

  * hdi gains a density method, which can handle discontinuous HDIs. This is
  used for the posterior density plots when showCurve = TRUE.

  * Enhancements to plots:
    o credMass = NULL suppresses plotting of the credible interval.
    o plotPost, the plot.BEST method, and plotAreaInROPE now make full
    use of the ... argument for additional graphical parameters.
    o default xlim for posterior density plots is now based on 99% HDI (not range).
    o plotPost and plot.BEST return an object of class 'histogram' invisibly.
    o plotPost deals properly with a vector of integers.

CHANGES in v.0.2.0 (2013-08-23)

  * Added function plotAreaInROPE.

  * In BESTpower, call to x11() (which is platform specific) changed to dev.new();
  in Rstudio, the plot is shown on active device.

  * BESTmcmc and BESTpower gain 'rnd.seed' arguments for reproducible output;
	testthat test files for BESTmcmc and BESTpower added.

  * makeData gains a showPlot argument.

  * Fixed bug in plot.BEST: the ... argument was not being passed to plotPost.

  * BESTmcmc has 'verbose' argument; setting verbose = FALSE (or 0) suppresses
	output to the Console (wish of Ben Marwick).

  * BESTpower also has 'verbose' argument; here verbose = 0 (or FALSE)
	suppresses all output, verbose = 1 (or TRUE) provides just a progress bar;
	verbose = 2 (the default) displays full details.
